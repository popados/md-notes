## Specifications

Goal: 30-day challenge of game design. Create video logs. Try engines. Finish tutorials. Put together something.

Unreal vs Unity is the main question. Unreal is better at building environments and generating quick animations and rigs. Unity is more solo developer-friendly(?)

Going with Unity because I know it.

[Brackeys Tower Defense Tutorial](https://youtu.be/beuoNuK2tbk?si=zTOue-hIGsvhsxBi)

Build a tower defense grid that allows units to move from one location to another. Using pathfinding algorithms and prefabs the units will follow the path. Towers can attack the units.

### Day 002 | 10/24/2024 - Thursday

#### Book in a Month

Reading a book that helps you write an entire manuscript within 30 days. I will begin with the steps for eachday and continue until I complete the goal of that day.

#### Answer these questions today

**How will you feel if you are on your deathbed and never even gave writing a real shot? Will you feel as if you got all from life that you wanted to get? Will you feel like you missed out on something meaningful?**

I probably wouldn't notice much. Becoming published has never been a "passion" of mine. What I want to do is build a world that can be lived in. Or create dialogue that will be remembered.

**What events in your life do you remember fondly? Why do you think these events stand out in your memory? Recalling areas of succeses in your life and focusing on them can keep you moving forward now.**

Breakup, moving, meeting people. Learning music. Finding new music. Learning to code. Creating my first programs myself.

**What goals have you already achieved in life? List everything- Boosting self-esteem.**

Achievements

- Lived
- Can code
- Semi well-read
- Musical
- None of these are achievements.
- I got clean once. Before. It was a time.

#### Motivation Questions

Why do you want to write?

- Writing is the ability to create a new world or character and bring that to life with real situations and reactions. As well as values and beliefs that hold them together.

Why do you have to write?

- For video games.

How will your life be different after you finish this manuscript? What will change?

- Taking something from start to finish and having something that can be published is a good feeling. It will give me a sense of accomplishment. The changes will be small and gradual, however, after the 30 days it will look like much more.

How will your life be different after you finish three manuscripts? Feel like a "real" writer?

- This will feel like completing 3 acts for a play or writing 3 characters motivations and plot devices for a singular story. Three is alot of writing thats 90 days of writing this.

How will you feel about yourself after you finish this manuscript? More confidence?

- Accomplished

How will this feeling help you accomplish other things in life?

- Shows that I am capable of doing work on a schedule.

Darkest Dungeon meets Baulder's Gate 3

Each NPC has intelligence and psych weights that are manipulated by the scenarios around them.

#### Game Design Ideas

- **Game Ideas**

  - Write out the ideas in a new md file(?)
    - NErH just write it in this document for now.

  Let's build a pro and con list.

  - **Questions to ask in log:**
    - Where did I start?
    - Which engine? Unity. For sure.
    - What have I done? Not much lool.
    - Why do I want to do this?
    - Talk about goals.
    - Add new goals and mini rewards.
    - How to "gamify" game design? LOL.

  Today is more of a design document day where I determine what direction I want to go.

  - **Steps for today**

    1. Ask questions of people [x]
    2. Get back into Unity
       - Found tutorial I want to follow
       - Look for assets
    3. Speak about what I want to make
       - Talk about where I want to go with this
    4. Decide on focus
       - Game type
    5. Write notes
    6. Tutorial
    7. Article/VLog
    8. Repeat
