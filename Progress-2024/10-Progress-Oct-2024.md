Today I woke up later than usual but played games all morning. This was a net result of 1-2 so far? Ended 2-2 I believe and one leaver game. I want to get some more stuff done today. I did laundry yesterday. Time to clean the living room and then get some of my stuff reorganized.

Made time to clean and pulled my stuff from under the table. Now I need to clean the bookshelf and move them around.

Going to dinner with my Dad maybe. Got Gyro 360 for dinner. It was good. Watched Robinhood the new Netflix movie. Also

Looking to get more coding and writing done. Let's leave up the markdown file. Get used to VIM and then go from there. Learning the shortcuts and the different ways of copying and pasting is interesting. I don't know what registers are yet.

Played some games. Interesting. Lost alot. Like alot alot. Laggy. Spells not going. ODD-MONEY.

### 004 10/10/2024 - Thursday

> Today being Thursday is Arthur Dent's day. He never figured them out. He heard Jesus died on a Thursday. It was an unpleasant day for alot of people.
> Then the Internet was born. Bad move. Not as bad as some other stuff that has happened. However, generally not a good move. It made things smaller. Good riddance to slow correspondence.

What I want to do today is clean up some of the bookshelf. Move the table to the bookshelf then move the PC to the wall next to the window. The PC will still be on top of the bookshelf. This will prevent smoke and ashe from entering the chasis.
