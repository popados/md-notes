### Day 21 | 10/29/2024 - Tuesday

Today has been long. I'm tired all the time. Getting through depression is a pain. I'm making myself get through some work. It's alot tougher than I thought because of my head wounds. More than likely I will attempt some rebound and find out how to do stuff infront of people.

I generally type how I speak. Uncouth and less than standard. Many of my words used are explicitly simple in order to reach more audience members.

Work on Loom videos...... GET TO WORK ME. Ask questions? What do I want my audience to learn? Who is the audience? When am I going to get to the primary objective.
