### Day 01 | 10/7/2023 - Saturday

I am writing out questions and ideas for my poster topic. The working title will be ***Cybercrime: History and Terminology.***

To me this is interesting because its a cross-section of Computer Science, Linguistics, and Criminology/Criminal Justice.

Overall I want to see what is being done in the world of law to deal with cybercrime.

Descriptive study.


### Day 02 | 10/17/2023 - Tuesday

Introduction writing day.

Describe and summarize points I want to make.

- Analysis
- Make points and thesis
- Start of abstract
- What am I doing
  - What to learn
  - How I want to present to others
  - Types of Research

Start answering the questions I have. Summarize articles.

Write a what and why introduction. Explain what and how this emerging subset of crime.

### Day number something | 11/9/2023 - Thursday

Changing the topic from all cyber/technology topics to specifically the cybercrimes and what signs there are to detect potential problems.

How do I illicit???

- Ask questions

- Get details

- Listen for common phrases

- Recording/Transcribing

-  This used as a noun and direct verb

- Stand up and other presentation based words used daily in scrum meetings.

### Day 01 | 10/7/2023 - Saturday



***

### Something like 6 months later | 3/13/2024 - Wednesday

Compile some of my stuff for Anime/Gaming and Language within Society. 

This thought can encompass internet speak as well as the spread(jargon term exist?) of words.

League terms becoming common? Perhaps again? Boosted, carried, supported, team comp, probe, drone, crit

***

### 005 | 3/14/2024 - Thursday

Read through my notes. Write up a few paragraphs that describe what I'm looking at.

Discourse of internet slang.

Use of cybercrime/security/resilience(Explain this).

***

### 006 | 3/17/2024 - Sunday

Working on a Word document for my teacher that compiles this information into something that could be used to describe language in society. Adding new parts to this over time. Lately my focus has changed towards technology and ecology.

The shift is towards the whole AMOC(Atlantic meridional overturning circulation) shift that is predicted over the next 50 years. They now can use technology as a path to project the changes in a more precise timetable.

Look at SOLID protocol for data distribution on the web. Read and analyze the document.

This might need a new name because of SOLID principles. It gets confusing for newbies and those who only work in data and not development.

(SOLID Protocol)[https://solidproject.org/TR/protocol]


***

### 007 | 3/18/2024 - Monday

Bringing this document to my teacher to get a new idea of where I want to go with my final paper.

Go one step down and then link back to the surface representation.



How technology relates to Language and Society?

Electon year might be important to how data is transfered in today's world.

- Through data
  - transfer
  - uptake
  - recommendations
- Definitions of words used in cyberspace

come up with random titles to focus in on topic

3 stages 

observation
organizational
explanation


data source :

from communitites that are virtual


- pop culture

- gaming 

- TV

- Hacking (White, Black, Gray)


morally ambigious as in they can "steal, lie, cheat" to get their way but refuse to cross certain "dangerous" lines.

- robin hood

- innovators

- less "dark" crimes

- Kevin Mitnick -> write a small 

start limiting

more of an abstraction with communities

start tallying to find percentages of where i got the examples

- community

- TV

- Cyberspace

- pop culture

- books

- musics

cover steps

data gathering techniques


where did i get everything from - unusual space

reframe hacking

-manifested

-approcahing from new angle

How to define terms and then cite stuff

Seriousness of hacking


***

### 008 | 3/19/2024 - Tuesday

Brainstorm some working titles for my final paper. This can describe the relation between the words I want to discuss and how they are understood in society.

***

### 009 | 3/20/2024 - Wednesday


changing SVO to action participle subject

instead of subject verb object

dont mind the gap
***

### 010 | 3/22/2024 - Friday




Freezing is being broken more and more. Such as bottom to top, veritas aquitas; et nometre padre. is backwards from the saaying in the movie "The Boondock Saints." Forwards and backwards; back and forth. Both are opposite freezing models.

```
Markers for the physical realm are intricate. Linguistic features are based on how the language is presented and changes in complexity depending on the discourse. Features to look for in the linguistic analysis of landscapes include placement, timing, touch, smell, and hearing. Other indicators of speech include body language, speech tone, and pitch. From there, socio-political messages are associated with those senses. The semantic nature of the language can be inferred by how the message is received. As well as sensory and speech-specific attributes, there are semiotic features.

#### Questions

- How are people using cybercrime? Differ from usages.

- Snowden usage and how people view crime and heroic acts.]

- Nature of gray hat hacking?
  - Why and how?
  - Whoe


- What is hacking? Or a hack?
- How is jargon used? Why must the wording be precise?
- Perception of hackers? Media? Reality? (Sideline but still there)
- What words scream cybercrime? Do ransomware notes/emails exist? Do we analyze them the same as a regular ransom note?
- How does the industry view cybercrime vs the public?
- Is there a name for people who fall for cybercrime attacks?
  - Pejorative terms?
- Are there "missions" for hacker groups? Malicious vs white hat groups?
  - maybe look at hate groups too for discrimitary patterns
- How someone outside of tech can show me new perspectives?
- Why is it ethical, what words?
- Malicious Intent?
- AI core values?
  - They changed with Altmans ousting and reinstating as CEO of openAI
  - 
- How devs use yes as a way to illicit more information rather than affrimatives

**Too broad of scope**

- Why do people commit these crimes? Do they happen all the time?*
- Is it more profitable to do cybercrime?*
- Why is cryptography important?*
- What are damages done by cybercrime?*
- Are lack of laws and education the reason why crime is so prevelant online? (save for forensic linguistics)*

*shelved

This is a list I was thinking thorugh over the weekend. Some stuff I'm wondering is specific to the idea that "cybercrime" is the term we should use to describe damages performed on the internet.

My thought process for this is give evidence for changing terms and bringing some of these terms to the legal world. Not sure where I should go from here. Just going to keep expanding this document with stuff.

Looking to expand my todo list involving research.

Lit Review. Find out what others have written.

##### Linguistic Analysis

- Pick 4 to 6 phrases within the context of cybercrime
- Historical useage/etymology
- Memes/gifs
- Changes over time
- Acronyms
- Abbrevs
- Semantics
- Pragmatics
- named after someone
- word formation
- rhetoric
- variation and dialect
- authorship
- commonality
- discourse markers
  - transition words
  - meanings behind stuff can be shifted
  
whether Grammarly suggestions are now AI or not.Is changing the transition words a good idea with my grammar assistant

does the constitute a plagiarized paper? 

The discourse markers are better than the ones I would use.

My language is dull compared to what is offered through grammarly suggestions.

What do I do.

Here are some suggestions:
- How are online landscapes different from physical landscapes?
- How are online landscapes different from one another?
- Where would you place online landscapes in the ‘Top down’/‘bottom up’ distinction?
- What are some of the signs used in these spaces? What is their function?
- Consider how features of this landscape - e.g. acronyms, emojis, etc. - change in meaning as
they are used repeatedly.
- Is there a relationship between one’s online identity and the basic feature of anonymity in these
spaces?

> Title – Cybercrime: History and Terminology

**Focus**
My research will attempt to answer questions concerning crime in the modern era, specifically cyberspace. By finding evidence dealing with cybercrime, we can attempt to shine a light on the types of terminology, history, and legal precedents that this type of crime will have.

**Description** –  
Terminology, history, and legal precedents are the highlights of this proposal. I will answer questions about how, when, and why cyberspace must be looked at for research within linguistics. Some questions will be answered: How does the industry view this versus public opinion? Is it more profitable for the individual to do cybercrime? Are there “missions” for hacker groups? Aside from this, a historical view of the Internet and its activities will be provided.

>Some stuff that stood out to me is how the deposition was first presented. The use of phrases such as “is believed” and “more mg, more money” made me think of how easy it is to fall into money schemes when the product sells itself and creates its own market. Should I include my own experiences? The layer behind the direct crisis was another crisis of similar magnitude that was almost the same but affected specifically black families. Crack sold itself, homie. OxyContin was made for a “6 to 10” range of pain. It basically sells itself. 
watching the show "painkiller" has many parts that show how linguistics and specifically forensic linguistics is used everyday and more importantly in deposition rooms.

the story itself is elaborate and dramatized. However the parts of the show that showed how language is important are excellent examples to explore a linguistic toolkit.

Starts with deposition of edie, who is an investigator for the AG. She is reluctant because the people "responsible" are "untouchable". Opinion is that while the people responsible were liable for the original creation of the drug. Many of the symptoms described are just as much facets of society as a whole and how prone to addiction people are.

I’m gonna stop looking at Reddit at night

Lighted — Today at 1:21 AM
phone usage is the worse

haunter — Today at 6:24 AM
all this extra money and the still cant hire GM moderators or have non-automated punishment systems or hire an economist to help with the bot problem

Pookenstein — Today at 9:23 AM
an economist isnt gonna help the bot problem lol. thats a problem of programming and counter programming.
[9:23 AM]
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnacVVjI1A4
YouTube
Pirate Software
Ye Olde Bot Detection

[9:23 AM]
imagine this, but for 20 years

haunter — Today at 9:29 AM
lol dang
[9:31 AM]
i guess wow isnt a tile based game so you dont have a packet driven software doing the movement? i thought they looked for the network packet and banned all players using that specific software that attacked that one spot.
[9:32 AM]
the whole economist thing is stop the world from going crazy when 1 earthroot is worth a gold
[9:33 AM]
imagine something that costs 1 silver starting to cost 1 gold cuz the player who farmed it and everyone else is like "shit the supply isnt there anymore let's tax this shit"
[9:34 AM]
a gold is a bit much but 10 silver for earthroot when its coppers right now? yeah i might pass

Pookenstein — Today at 9:35 AM
youre biggest problem is if you do any of that, you punish the people who dont have the gold, but still need the earthroot

haunter — Today at 9:37 AM
idk the numbers but just as many people play to econ as players raiding otherwise there wouldnt be dedicated communities to gold making. but thats why i think someone that knows market value is a good idea. these are just ideas im coming up with cuz i played eve for the past year
[9:38 AM]
not saying dont do anything but it isnt just simple as manually banning players now however they need to do manual checks to stop the automated system from making a mistake
[9:38 AM]
idk if i lose a bank of briarthorn i might be salty but i guess it adds time value to the game

Pookenstein — Today at 9:42 AM
comparing eve to wow is something you shouldnt do. Blizz's goals for wow's success are based on MAUs and (at least for a while) was based on hours played. what you can do in eve is much more player centric in almost every aspect, whereas the only control players have is the setting of prices with a set AH cut.

haunter — Today at 9:43 AM
what should they look at? or do? cause for 20 years they've been the model mmo that everyone looked at. so now that they are fucking up every other mmo that handles bots is a better model
[9:44 AM]
i'm just trying to be realistic with what has to be done its not just a management problem
[9:44 AM]
but their management did fuck up alot of good employees

Pookenstein — Today at 9:44 AM
They introduced one of the best solutions many year ago: the token

haunter — Today at 9:45 AM
and thats not something we can do anything about but it shows why and where their priorities lie and if anyone left cares about the game they should be looking at the fresh econ and deciding if its a good idea
[9:45 AM]
idk would you want a token in sod?
[9:45 AM]
it's fair to say yes

Pookenstein — Today at 9:45 AM
whether you want it isnt the point. If bots get bad enough, thats where its gonna go.

haunter — Today at 9:45 AM
right now bots keep the supply up
[9:45 AM]
they ban alot of the exp bots right away
[9:47 AM]
idk i have opinions of the financial side of gaming. the industry is literally hemorrhaging money right now and can't keep talent so idk what the next step is but i still want to work in it

Pookenstein — Today at 9:47 AM
the problems with the industry are not related at all to anything to do with bots.

haunter — Today at 9:48 AM
???? if they cant hire people to look into the problem it wont get fixed
[9:49 AM]
who will work to fix the bot problem if the industry doesnt have money to hire people to do the WORK that it takes to ban these people and find the creators and prosecute them

Pookenstein — Today at 9:51 AM
the industry does have the money to hire, that makes no sense. The point for the subject of bots is how many man hours do you want to spend fighting it.
[9:52 AM]
ultimately, they are controlled by people paying money like everyone else, but they affect the market in a skewed manner. if you introduce a way to ease that burden of inflation for the casual player, it becomes much less of a problem

@Pookenstein
the industry does have the money to hire, that makes no sense. The point for the subject of bots is how many man hours do you want to spend fighting it.

haunter — Today at 9:54 AM
have you looked at the money coming in? esports essentially failed and that was 100s of millions of dollars people have to settle on and buyout of

Pookenstein — Today at 9:55 AM
esports failed because it was a bubble. investors were promised insane returns for a market that was inflated by its own promises. nothing to do with bots

haunter — Today at 9:55 AM
what is the problem right now? they are keeping raw mats supply up
[9:55 AM]
if you say they are keeping it pay to win
[9:55 AM]
the token just incentivizes that more
[9:56 AM]
that puts more burden on the regular play to invest time and energy into finding their supply themselves
[9:58 AM]
bro if you have it figured out like it sounds like you do go into blizz and demand the reins. im just being smart about it. paying a campus of 2000 employees a yearly salary of 40,000 dollars comes out to about 80million 100 million a year? so they could dedicate that to farming out bots and getting the money back in their hands (edited)
[10:00 AM]
100 mill sorry

Pookenstein — Today at 10:03 AM
lmao, ok. I'll bring it back around then. This is a problem that has gone back and forth for literally 20 years. Just like blizzard can hire people solely to handling the problem of bots, the bot developers can spend just as much time counterprogramming. 
None of this has even mentioned the fact that all it takes for a bot farm to start back up again is just buying new accounts.
This is pointless talking about anymore, its just going in circles, and im not about to solve world peace and hunger.

haunter — Today at 10:06 AM
mind if i take this convo for my notes? i can redact your name. all i really did was say the "problems" are still there. its not simple. i dont agree with everything they say or do but knowing programming or just watching the articles i see whats supposedly the "issue". idk why you have a problem with me i'm just trying to figure out if its worth it by spitballing
[10:06 AM]
answer seems no
